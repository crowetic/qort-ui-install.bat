# qort-ui-install.bat
Windows install script for Qortal UI (from source with all dependencies and compiling/running)

1. Download the script
2. Place the script into the folder you want the UI repos setup in
3. Run the script 'as admin' (right click, 'run as admin')
RUNNING AS ADMIN IS VERY IMPORTANT, IF YOU DO NOT, THE DEPENDENCIES WILL NOT INSTALL CORRECTLY.
4. let it run, and do not mess with any windows that pop up.
5. access the UI via - http://localhost 

To run the UI server after first install, run the 'start-UI.bat' script.

YOU NEED THE QORTAL CORE RUNNING IF YOU PLAN TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE BLOCKCHAIN.
